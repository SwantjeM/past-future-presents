# past-future-presents
Send future-you a present, and receive presents from past-you.

This web app asks you for something nice that today-you has done, to benefit future-you: a present. Whether that is doing laundry, making extra food for lunch, or getting a treat from the bakery. 
The inputs are time-stamped and stored in local browser storage. 
Tomorrow, the presents from today's past-you appear, when you refresh the page, so you are reminded of the nice things that past-you has done for you.
